    <h2>"Fire And Ice"</h2>
    <pre><big>
Some say the world will end in fire,

Some say in ice.

From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire

I hold with those who favor fire.

But if it had to perish twice,

I think I know enough of hate

To say that for destruction ice

Is also great

And would suffice.</big>
